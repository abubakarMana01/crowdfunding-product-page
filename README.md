### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For the most part I just revised my knowloedge on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and improved my understanding of some higher order JS functions

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

### Continued development

I'll like to focus on building this with React JS. I'm currently working on my react skills

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped revise how to use some css properties like 'overflow: scroll' and a few others. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article which helped me undestand some properties of 'classList' and a few others in Vanilla JavaScript. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
